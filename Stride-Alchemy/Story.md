# Story

## World

Earth has been inhabitable for a century. Each country conducted researches on a new type of energy source left the earth to terraform other planets. The new source of energy was produced from ``Terradium``, a new element that has advantageous properties. Once the power was harnessed the few humans left boarded multiple spaceships and started scooting for new planets to live in. While no exoplanets has been found, humans retrieve materials from other planets in order to synthesize the element needed to care for the ecosystem in their spaceship.

## Characters

- Zora Ames : Space engineer from the ``AS-EUR 6502`` (pronounced Azur) space scooting ship. She has a particular space suit model powered by ``Terradium``. The space suit was designed by her to be modular. She spent her childhood in the spaceship learning about physics and electronics from the researchers on board. The spacesuit she designed allows her to visit hazardous places.

- The ``AS-EUR 6502`` researchers : A group of kind and compassionate scientists who helps Zora by providing her analysis and information during her scooting missions. They tend to worry about the ecological impact they have on the many places they visit.

- The ``AS-EUR 6502`` is a spaceship designed by an Asia-Europe team, powered by a ``Stride Engine`` which make space jumps possibles.

- The twins : Two bio-engineered humans trained in combat and survival to be a new generation of super-humans.

### The space station - Background story

Upon leaving earth, a team highly skilled biologist gathered enough data on the human genome to be able to bio-engineer new humans, making them able to live in hazardous planets.
During the travel, two researchers, John Desmond and Paul Abbot, found a way to alter the behavior of those genetically engineered humans. They described the result as enhanced physical nature and decision making, and later added that the whole thought process could be wired so that their personality could be shaped in specific ways as well as their ability to sustain hazardous environment.
Two prototypes of bio-engineered humans were given birth, with that, a set of challenges were built in the space station to test them. They were told that once they solve all the challenges they would receive a gift granting them great power. Once they've reached the last room, the whole crew was there to congratulate them and offer them two spacecrafts.
As they realize they were considered as tools, the twins decided to slaughter everyone and leave

## Game Story

The ``AS-EUR 6502`` discovered an abandonned spacestation, according to their analysis the spaceship contains some ``Terradium`` resources but no traces of life. The team decides to send Zora to scoot the station and retrieve the ``Terradium``.
Upon arriving at the station, Zora finds signs of struggles. Zora decides to investigate the station on her way to retrieve the ``Terradium``.
She finds a set of rooms filled with challenges and riddles designed to train humans and with the help of her crew mates, she goes through these challenges.
As she's advancing in the space station, she discovers the story of the two sibblings that decided to end humanity.
Then last room has a holographic messages meant for the two sibblings. The message congratulates them on solving all the puzzles but their work is not done yet, more is to come. Zora receives an intel from her crew, apparently, some bodies were found floating around the space station.
